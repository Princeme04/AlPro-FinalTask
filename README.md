## 🌐 Binary Search Tree and Dijkstra Algorithm

This repository contains the **final group project (UAS)** for the  
**Algoritma Pemrograman** course.

The project focuses on the implementation, explanation, and comparison of two fundamental data structures and algorithms:

- 🌳 **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- 🛣️ **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm**

The goal of this project is not only to make the algorithms work, but to demonstrate a clear understanding of how they operate, when they should be used, and their computational characteristics.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🧩 Implement a **Binary Search Tree** with standard operations  
- 🧭 Implement **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find the shortest path in a weighted graph  
- ⏱️ Analyze **time and space complexity**  
- 🧠 Apply algorithmic thinking and structured programming principles  
- 🤝 Practice teamwork and version control using **Git/GitHub**

## 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST)

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children and follows a strict ordering rule:

- Values in the **left subtree** are smaller than the parent node  
- Values in the **right subtree** are greater than the parent node  

This property allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics

- Tree-based data structure  
- Maintains data in **sorted order**  
- Average time complexity: **O(log n)**  
- Worst-case time complexity: **O(n)** (when the tree becomes unbalanced)

### 🔍 Supported Operations

- Insertion of nodes  
- Searching for a value  
- Deletion of nodes  
- Tree traversal:
  - Inorder  
  - Preorder  
  - Postorder  

### 🌍 Applications

- Searching and indexing data  
- Implementing ordered sets and maps  
- Database indexing  
- Expression parsing  

### ⚠️ Limitations

- Performance degrades if the tree becomes **unbalanced**  
- Requires balancing techniques (e.g., **AVL Tree**, **Red-Black Tree**) for guaranteed efficiency

## 🛣️ Dijkstra Algorithm

**Dijkstra’s Algorithm** is used to find the **shortest path** from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with **non-negative edge weights**.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics

- Greedy algorithm  
- Uses a priority queue (or array) to select the nearest unvisited node  
- Guarantees optimal shortest path  

### 🌍 Applications

- Network routing  
- GPS and navigation systems  
- Transportation and logistics  

### ⚠️ Limitations

- Does not work with negative edge weights
