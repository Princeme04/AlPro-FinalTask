## 🌐 Binary Search Tree and Dijkstra Algorithm

This repository contains the **final group project (UAS)** for the  
**Algoritma dan Pemrograman (AlPro)** course.

The project focuses on the implementation, explanation, and comparison of two fundamental data structures and algorithms:

- 🌳 **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- 🛣️ **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm**

The goal of this project is not only to make the algorithms work, but to demonstrate a clear understanding of how they operate, when they should be used, and their computational characteristics.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🧩 Implement a **Binary Search Tree** with standard operations
- 🧭 Implement **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find the shortest path in a weighted graph
- ⏱️ Analyze **time and space complexity**
- 🧠 Apply algorithmic thinking and structured programming principles
- 🤝 Practice teamwork and version control using **Git/GitHub**

---

## 🛣️ Dijkstra Algorithm

**Dijkstra’s Algorithm** is used to find the **shortest path** from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with **non-negative edge weights**.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics

- Greedy algorithm
- Uses priority queue (or array) to select the nearest unvisited node
- Guarantees optimal shortest path

### 🌍 Applications

- Network routing
- GPS and navigation systems
- Transportation and logistics

### ⚠️ Limitations

- Does not work with negative edge weights

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 💻 Programming Language: *(C / C++ / Java / Python)*
- 🛠️ Development Tools: Git, GitHub
- 🖥️ Platform: Console-based application
